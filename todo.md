In this exercise you will take a local version of tic-tac-toe game implemented in React and make it a true multiplayer game with a backend in express.js Start with the code and assets in this tutorial: 
https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe


- You need to separate game logic and display. Game logic needs to be on the server only. If the client can claim a win condition simply by notifying the server, that's a fail condition for your interview ðŸ˜ƒ
- You will use websockets to communicate with the server.
- You have creative freedom over the websocket protocol, however, your code will be tested if it is able to prevent illegal moves (eg, player 0 pressing three buttons in a row).
- You need to demonstrate security thinking. If a client can cheat the game in any way, including injecting calls from dev console, that will be counted as a fail.
- You don't need to implement any kind of lobby or matching system. The first client to connect should be player 0, the second client should be player 1, and any other clients should be rejected until the game is reset.
- Game reset is optional, if you run out of time a solution that only runs one game will be accepted.
- After the game has ended you should display a victory and defeat message to the right players.
- Put the codes on your Github repo and  send the link to me. 

# NEXT STEPS
return game status for debugging purposes periodically to another page
close player details on connection close 
Add commands for MOVE, GAME_WIN, announce winner if player takes too long to move. 
Take back aka history not be implemented. 
Validate message on socket to check if the request is tampered. (imeplement security or wss ?)


## Steps to execute


```bash 
# cd to server 

yarn 
 PORT=3001 npm start # starts server on port 30
# cd to client dir 

yarn 
npm run dev 
```

Open http://localhost:3000 . the player can only join at the moment
